# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using multiple classification models while handling class imbalance to improve performance.

## 📊 Dataset
- Diabetes dataset containing medical diagnostic measurements.
- Features include glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Handling Class Imbalance
- Random Over Sampling (ROS) was used to balance the dataset and improve model accuracy.

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing
2. Handling missing values
3. Feature scaling
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Performance evaluation

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn

## Future Improvements
- SMOTE instead of Random Over Sampling
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment
